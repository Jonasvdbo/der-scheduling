# DER-scheduling

This project aims to create an Open source scheduling stack for distributed energy resources (DER) control according to IEC 61850.
The main functionalities will be to control a DERs regarding:
- absolute power output
- maximal power output
- turning them on or off

Currently, the project is in planning phase collecting [requirements](https://github.com/alliander-opensource/der-scheduling/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md) and creating a [system overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alliander-opensource/der-scheduling/main/images/system-overview.drawio.png).


This is a collaboration of [Alliander](alliander.com), [Fraunhofer ISE](https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/) and [MZ Automations](https://www.mz-automation.de). 

The work will be based upon MZ Automations [IEC 61850 Protocol Library](https://www.mz-automation.de/communication-protocols/iec-61850-protocol-library/).
